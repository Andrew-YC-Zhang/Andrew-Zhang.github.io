Hello, I'm Andrew!

I am currently a PhD candidate in Economics at the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Hong Kong.

My research interests lie in organizational economics, contract theory, and personnel economics. In particular, my current research focuses on the challenges faced by middle managers in managing dynamic incentives. My job market paper develops a relational contracting model to investigate how managers selectively enforce rigid rules. 

I am on the job market for the 2024-2025 academic year. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:zyc616@connect.hku.hk).

I will present my paper "Optimal Talent Hoarding" at the poster session of ASSA 2025 Annual Meeting. If you are attending, please feel free to stop by and chat with me.
